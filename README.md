Please ensure you have an internet connection to see fonts and some other assets.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## App features:
- Add a todo item
- Delete a todo item
- Check and uncheck items
- Edit items
- Automatic saving as you type

## Features I'd like to add
- Make more mobile responsive
- Enable dark mode
- Simplify website design

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
